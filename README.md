### 🚀 About Me
I’m passionate about building **AI-driven data systems** that bridge machine learning, automation, and analytics.  
My work focuses on combining **data engineering, cloud, and generative AI** to deliver real-time insights and intelligent automation.

💡 Key interests:
- Generative AI pipelines (LLMs, RAG, vector databases, agents)  
- Real-time data engineering (Kafka, Airflow, AWS)  
- Machine learning for text and structured data  
- Interactive dashboards with Streamlit, Power BI, Tableau

### 🚧 Work in Progress

#### ⚙️ AI Sports Analytics Platform  
A real-time **sports data pipeline and analytics dashboard** that ingests live match data (e.g., football or cricket) using **Kafka streams** and **Airflow DAGs**, stores processed data in **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**, and updates live **Streamlit dashboards** for match insights and win-probability predictions.

**Focus areas**
- Kafka for event ingestion and topic-based data streaming  
- Airflow for orchestrating ETL and ML retraining jobs  
- XGBoost + Random Forest models for dynamic win predictions  
- AWS EC2, Lambda, and S3 integration for scalable deployment  

> 🎯 *Goal:* Create a modular, cloud-native architecture for real-time sports analytics.

#### 💬 Spotify Playlist Generator (Gen-AI)  
An AI-driven **semantic music recommender** that uses **OpenAI embeddings** and **FAISS vector databases** to generate playlists from free-text prompts such as  
> “Energetic EDM tracks for gym workouts” or  
> “Calm acoustic songs for late-night studying.”

**Core components**
- OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` for semantic search  
- FAISS for high-speed similarity search over track embeddings  
- Spotify API for metadata and playback links  
- LangChain for modular prompt → embedding → retrieval flow  
- Streamlit frontend for user interaction  

> 🎯 *Goal:* Build a generative AI interface for personalized, natural-language playlist creation.
